Based on my earlier [digit recognition neural network project](/blog/2019/04/21/digit-recognition-neural-network), I build a small game called *digits.ai*. I saved the weights and biases calculated in the earlier project into a .pkl file and set up a little pygame that allows the user to draw a number on the screen. Once the user presses **guess**, the image is converted to black and white and then decomposed into a 28 x 28 pixel format. Pushing this data through the neural net with the aforementioned weights and biases, the game guesses what number the user drew and displays that on the screen.

The game is still not very great since the numbers must be drawn very clearly for it to guess correctly and there are still a few bugs to work out before the GUI looks nice. However, as a first machine learning project, I think it is pretty solid.
