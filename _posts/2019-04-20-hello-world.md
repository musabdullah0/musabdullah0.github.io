This website is meant to be sort of a personal portfolio of all my projects and interests. From artificial
intelligence to data science to little games, I'm not too sure exactly where I want to be 5 or 10 years from now,
but what I do know is that I want to play a part in advancing the applications of technology in everyday life.

This is just a sample post to check if my layout is working out, so that's about all I have for today.
